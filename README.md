# Electroniz-Lakehouse


## Project Summary

Electroniz-Lakehouse is a data engineering and analytics project for Electroniz, a leading big-box store that sells electronic goods. The goal of the project is to formulate a modern business strategy to diversify revenue by streamlining data engineering and analytics operations.

### Vision

The chief technology officer (CTO) has shared their vision of the future in the form of a diagram. The diagram outlines Electroniz's current operations, including the sale of electronic goods in brick-and-mortar stores throughout the United States (US) and on their e-commerce site. The e-commerce site allows shipping to Canada, the United Kingdom (UK), and Germany. Shipping is handled using external vendors such as DHL, Purolator, and United Parcel Service (UPS).

### High-level Details

The CTO has provided some high-level details that will help kick-start the process:

- Electroniz's current analytics platform is using an on-prem SQL Server database.
- The company plans to streamline inventory, shipping, accounting, and advertising using sales data.
- Electroniz must comply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) regulations, requiring proper masking and encryption of personally identifiable information (PII) data.
- Currently, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes are performed once a day, resulting in a 24-hour lag for updating shipping and inventory. This lag has caused delays in shipping and order cancellations due to items being out of stock.
- Electroniz aims to achieve a near-real-time sales analytics platform with a maximum data lag of 1 hour.
- The company wants to use intelligent analytics based on user traffic on its e-commerce website to streamline budget allocations for advertising and marketing.

### Next Steps

To proceed with the project, the following steps can be taken:

1. Assess the current data engineering and analytics infrastructure.
2. Identify areas for improvement, such as implementing real-time data processing and reducing data lag.
3. Evaluate options for migrating the analytics platform to a cloud-based solution.
4. Develop a strategy for securely handling PII data in compliance with PCI regulations.
5. Design and implement an ETL process that updates shipping and inventory in near-real-time.
6. Explore intelligent analytics techniques to optimize advertising and marketing budget allocations based on user traffic.

By following these steps, Electroniz can achieve its goal of streamlining data engineering and analytics operations to diversify revenue and better serve its customers.
